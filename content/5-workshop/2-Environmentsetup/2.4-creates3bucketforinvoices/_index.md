#### Overview

In this step, you will create an **S3 bucket** to store invoice files uploaded by users. This bucket will be created in the **ap-southeast-1(Singapore)** region, and you will also configure an **event notification** to trigger a **Lambda function** whenever a new file is uploaded into a specific folder.

---

#### Step 1: Access S3 Console

1. Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), search for **S3**, then select **S3** from the results.

💡 **Note:** Before creating the bucket, make sure you have selected the correct region **ap-southeast-1** in the upper right corner of the AWS Console screen.  
Creating the S3 bucket in the correct region is crucial for services like Lambda or Textract to work seamlessly.

💡 **Note:** Bucket names must be globally unique. You may add a suffix if the name is already taken, e.g., **invoice-upload-s3-bucket-113**.

3. Configure as follows:

    - **Name**: `TriggerLambdaOnUpload`
    - **Prefix**: `uploads/`
    - **Suffix**: _(leave blank)_
    - **Event types**: select `PUT` (All object create events)
    - **Destination**: select **Lambda function**
    - **Lambda function**: select `UploadInvoiceFileFunction`

    You will not see the Lambda function at this stage; therefore, proceed to create Lambda function #1 first, then return to complete this step.

If you don’t see the Lambda function listed, make sure it was created in the correct region **(ap-southeast-1)** and that the Lambda's IAM role has the **s3:PutBucketNotification** permission.
