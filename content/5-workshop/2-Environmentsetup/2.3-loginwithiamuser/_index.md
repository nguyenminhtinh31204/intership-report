#### Objective

In this step, you will log in using the **IAM User** that has been granted permissions to use the AWS Console. This is a mandatory step before deploying any resources.

---

#### Step 1: Open the browser in Incognito mode

-   Open Google Chrome (or your current browser) in **Incognito mode**.
-   Quick shortcut: Press **Ctrl + Shift + N**.
-   This prevents session conflicts if you're logged into multiple AWS accounts.

#### Step 2: Open the Excel file containing IAM User credentials

-   Open the Excel file you downloaded from the system administrator.
-   In this file, you'll find the following information:

    -   **Account ID**
    -   **IAM User name**
    -   **Password**

#### Step 3: Visit the IAM login page

-   Go to the IAM login URL in the following format:

    ```
    https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
    ```

    Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with the AWS account ID provided to you (e.g., `123456789012`).

---

#### Step 4: Enter login credentials

-   **IAM user name**: Enter the correct IAM username from the Excel file.
-   **Password**: Enter the corresponding password.

    -   Look at the **top-right corner** of the screen.
    -   Click on the current Region name.
    -   Select **Singapore** (ap-southeast-1).
