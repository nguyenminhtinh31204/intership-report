#### Overview

In this final cleanup step, you will check optional or secondary resources that may still exist after deleting the main components of the **Serverless AI Invoice Scanner** system.

The previous cleanup steps removed the main project resources:

- API Gateway
- Lambda Functions
- S3 Bucket
- DynamoDB Table
- Cognito User Pool
- Amplify Hosting App
- CloudWatch Log Groups
- IAM Roles and Policies

{{% notice info %}}
Section 7.9 is used to verify optional resources that may have been created depending on how you deployed or tested the project.

#### Resources to Check

After deleting the main resources, only check the optional resources below if you actually used them during the project.

| Resource | When to check |
|---|---|
| AWS Secrets Manager | If you stored the OpenAI API Key or other secrets in AWS. |
| Systems Manager Parameter Store | If you stored configuration values or API keys in Parameter Store. |
| CloudFormation Stack | If you deployed resources using a template, AWS SAM, or CloudFormation stack. |
| CloudWatch Alarms | If you created alarms for Lambda, API Gateway, or billing. |
| Resource Groups Tag Editor | If you used tags to manage project resources. |
| Billing / Cost Explorer | To confirm there are no unexpected AWS charges. |

---

#### Check AWS Secrets Manager

If you stored the **OpenAI API Key** in AWS Secrets Manager, check and delete the secret if it is no longer needed.

- Open the **AWS Management Console**.
- Search for and open **Secrets Manager**.
- Find secrets related to the project.

Example secret names:

```txt
openai-api-key
invoice-scanner-openai-secret
```

- Open the secret you want to check.
- Choose **Actions**.
- Choose **Delete secret**.
- Select the recovery window required by AWS.
- Confirm the secret deletion.

{{% notice warning %}}
Do not delete a secret if it is still being used by another project. The OpenAI API Key is sensitive information and should not be stored in frontend source code or a public repository.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Check Systems Manager Parameter Store

If you stored API keys or configuration values in **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**, check and delete any parameters that are no longer needed.

- Open the **AWS Management Console**.
- Search for and open **Systems Manager**.
- In the left navigation menu, choose **Parameter Store**.
- Find parameters related to the project.

Example parameter names:

```txt
/invoice-scanner/openai-api-key
/invoice-scanner/api-url
/invoice-scanner/s3-bucket
```

- Select the parameter that is no longer used.
- Choose **Delete**.

{{% notice info %}}
If the project does not use Parameter Store, you can skip this step.

#### Check CloudFormation Stack

If you deployed resources using **AWS CloudFormation**, **AWS SAM**, or another infrastructure template, check whether any stack still exists.

- Open the **AWS Management Console**.
- Search for and open **CloudFormation**.
- Choose **Stacks**.
- Find stacks related to the project.

Example stack names:

```txt
serverless-ai-invoice-scanner
invoice-scanner-stack
```

- If the stack is no longer needed, select the stack and choose **Delete**.

{{% notice warning %}}
Only delete a CloudFormation stack if you are sure it was created for this lab. Deleting a stack may remove multiple resources at the same time.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Check CloudWatch Alarms

If you created **CloudWatch Alarms** to monitor Lambda, API Gateway, or billing, delete alarms that are no longer used.

- Open the **CloudWatch** service.
- Choose **Alarms**.
- Choose **All alarms**.
- Find alarms related to the project.

Example alarm names:

```txt
InvoiceScannerLambdaErrorAlarm
InvoiceScannerAPIGateway5xxAlarm
```

- Select the alarm that is no longer used.
- Choose **Actions**.
- Choose **Delete**.

---

#### Check Resources with Tag Editor

If you added tags to project resources, you can use **Tag Editor** to quickly find remaining resources.

Example tag:

```txt
Project = ServerlessAIInvoiceScanner
```

How to use Tag Editor:

- Open **AWS Resource Groups & Tag Editor**.
- Choose **Tag Editor**.
- Select the AWS Region where you deployed the project.
- Search by tag or resource type.
- Check whether any resources related to the project still exist.

{{% notice info %}}
Tag Editor is most useful if you added tags during deployment. If you did not use tags, manually check the main AWS services instead.

#### Check Billing and Cost Explorer

After cleanup, you should check billing information to confirm that no unexpected services are still generating costs.

- Open **AWS Billing and Cost Management**.
- Choose **Bills** or **Cost Explorer**.
- Review the services that are generating costs.
- Pay attention to services such as:

```txt
Amazon S3
AWS Lambda
Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon API Gateway
Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon Cognito
AWS Secrets Manager
AWS Systems Manager
```

{{% notice warning %}}
Some billing data may take several hours or days to update. If you recently deleted resources, check again after some time.

| Authentication | The Cognito User Pool has been deleted. |
| API | API Gateway has been deleted. |
| Backend | Lambda Functions have been deleted. |
| File storage | The S3 Bucket has been deleted. |
| Database | The DynamoDB Table has been deleted. |
| Logs | CloudWatch Logs have been deleted. |
| Permissions | Unused IAM Roles and Policies have been deleted. |
| Optional resources | Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Alarms, Tag Editor, and Billing have been checked if used. |

#### Important Notes

{{% notice info %}}
Not every deployment uses all optional resources listed in Section 7.9. You only need to delete the resources that were actually created for this lab.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
Do not delete a resource if you are not sure it belongs to this project. Accidentally deleting resources may affect other applications or labs in the same AWS account.

To avoid future charges, check AWS Billing again after completing the cleanup process.

#### Conclusion

You have completed the final verification step after cleaning up the **Serverless AI Invoice Scanner** resources.

- The main project resources have been deleted.
- Optional resources such as Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, CloudFormation, and CloudWatch Alarms have been checked if used.
- Tag Editor can be used to review remaining resources if the project used tags.
- Billing has been reviewed to detect any unusual costs.
- This final step helps keep the AWS account clean and reduces the risk of unexpected charges.
